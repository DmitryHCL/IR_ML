# Predicting Research Octane Rating(RON) of gasoline
Example of usual workflow compiled in a single notebook.<br/>
There are dozens of other parameters that I would calculate (Cetane number, aromatics content, distillation characteristics and many others).<br/>
Normally I would store all helper functions in a separate helper_functions.py, however for this example every helper function is inside the nb.<br/>
Because sample size is usually pretty small (<100 samples) it is important to look for influential outliers.<br/>
